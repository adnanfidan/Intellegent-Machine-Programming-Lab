# Intelligent Machine Programming Lab

This repository contains three mini-projects developed as part of the Intelligent Machine Programming Lab course. Each project focuses on a different robotic task, implemented with a UR10e robot. These tasks were fundamental in learning how to code, control, and assign tasks to robots, providing hands-on experience with simulation environments and real-world robotic applications. 

## Projects Overview

### 1. Draw Circle Task
In this task, the UR10e robot draws a precise circular path. The project includes videos from both the simulation environment and the real-world setup, demonstrating the robot’s capability to perform smooth, controlled circular movements.

- **Media**: [Videos](Draw%20Circle/media)

### 2. Trajectory Planning and Impedance Control
This project implements trajectory planning and impedance control to achieve a whiteboard cleaning task. The robot traces a circular motion, maintaining gentle contact with the whiteboard surface. Impedance control allows the robot to respond dynamically to contact forces, ensuring the gripper detects and follows the board's surface accurately.

### 3. Infinity Draw and Hand-Guided Trajectory
This task focuses on guiding the UR10e robot to draw an infinity symbol and record hand-guided trajectories, which are then saved and replayed autonomously. The task demonstrates the robot’s ability to learn and replicate complex paths with high precision.
